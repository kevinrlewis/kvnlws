      | The Code Book, written by Simon Singh, was created to explain the history
      | and basics of cryptography. Due to the popularity
      | of The Code Book, Simon Singh distributed an application to help people learn about cryptography
      | through exercises and interactive tools. The goal of
      | the project was to rewrite the application because the
      | application is not usable within modern systems and
      | can only run older operating systems. I was unable
      | to obtain the source code of the original application
      | so I needed to re-implement the application from
      | scratch.
